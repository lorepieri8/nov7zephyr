Patch Lst:
   * Add missing header files symbols for Atmel SAM E70
      Several missing symbols for same70q21 SoC are added:
      - TC Channel Mode Register: Waveform Mode definitions
      - Legacy peripheral IDs definitions
      - DACC alternate pin functions

    * Remove unused and broken preprocessor macros
       Header files from Atmel ASF define several preprocessor macros
